**Repository: Time-optimal Swing-Up Inverted Pendulum**

**Description:**
This repository contains MATLAB implementations for the swing-up control of an inverted pendulum system. The project is divided into three main folders, each focusing on a specific aspect of the system:

1. **Optimization:**
   This folder contains MATLAB scripts and functions related to the optimization process. Various optimization techniques are explored here to minimize the time required for swinging up the inverted pendulum while adhering to system constraints.

2. **Simulink Model:**
   In this folder, you will find the Simulink model of the inverted pendulum system. The Simulink model is designed to simulate the dynamics of the pendulum and evaluate different control strategies.

3. **Parameter Estimation:**
   This folder houses MATLAB scripts and functions for parameter estimation. It focuses on identifying the parameters of the inverted pendulum system, which are crucial for accurate modeling and control design.

**Usage:**
- Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
- Navigate to the respective folders for optimization, Simulink model, or parameter estimation.
- Open the script and run the code with the appropriate data

**Dependencies:**
- MATLAB R2019a or later.
- Simulink (for running the Simulink model).
- CasADi
- Optimization Toolbox (for optimization scripts).
